# CommonUtilities

## Synopsis
CommonUtilities is a collection of utility classes and commonly useful/used
exceptions that make everyday programming in Java a lot easier.

## Availability
The CommonUtilities library is available via it's [GitHub.com repository](https://github.com/dimensionv/commonutilities), and through the central maven repository at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccommonutilities).

Simply add it as a dependency to your favorite build system / dependency management system, and you will be able to use it.

### Examples for Build-systems

#### Gradle

```
compile 'de.dimensionv:commonutilities:1.3.0'
```

#### Maven

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>de.dimensionv</groupId>
    <artifactId>commonutilities</artifactId>
    <version>1.3.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Documentation
The library is documented using JavaDoc. I took great care to explain everything properly, but feel free send patches with improvements where you think it's appropriate. In case I agree and find the time, I will update the library.
Besides being available through the same channels as the library itself, you can also read it directly online via my [javadoc-repository](http://javadoc.dimensionv.de/commonutilities/).

## Known Issues
Currently there are no issues known beside the possibility that a small number unit-tests might fail on Java 1.6 and below. However, this does not effect the library itself, only the unit-tests. I might fix that when I feel like it.

If you find any bugs, feel free to

* report them
* fix them and send the patches
