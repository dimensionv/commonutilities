{"name":"Commonutilities","tagline":"Collection of classes providing common utility functions","body":"# CommonUtilities\r\n\r\n## Synopsis\r\nCommonUtilities is a collection of utility classes and commonly useful/used\r\nexceptions that make everyday programming in Java a lot easier.\r\n\r\n## Availability\r\nThe CommonUtilities library is available via it's [GitHub.com repository](https://github.com/dimensionv/commonutilities), and through the central maven repository at [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccommonutilities).\r\n\r\nSimply add it as a dependency to your favorite build system / dependency management system, and you will be able to use it.\r\n\r\n### Examples for Build-systems\r\n\r\n#### Gradle\r\n\r\n```\r\ncompile 'de.dimensionv:commonutilities:1.3.0'\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Maven\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>de.dimensionv</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>commonutilities</artifactId>\r\n    <version>1.3.0</version>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\nThe library is documented using JavaDoc. I took great care to explain everything properly, but feel free send patches with improvements where you think it's appropriate. In case I agree and find the time, I will update the library.\r\nBesides being available through the same channels as the library itself, you can also read it directly online via my [javadoc-repository](http://javadoc.dimensionv.de/commonutilities/).\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\nCurrently there are no issues known beside the possibility that a small number unit-tests might fail on Java 1.6 and below. However, this does not effect the library itself, only the unit-tests. I might fix that when I feel like it.\r\n\r\nIf you find any bugs, feel free to\r\n\r\n* report them\r\n* fix them and send the patches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n ","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
